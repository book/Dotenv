NAME

    Dotenv - Support for "dotenv" in Perl

SYNOPSIS

        # basic operation
        use Dotenv;      # exports nothing
        Dotenv->load;    # merge the content of .env in %ENV

        # do it all in one line
        use Dotenv -load;

        # the source for environment variables can be a file, a filehandle,
        # a hash reference, an array reference and several other things
        # the sources are loaded in %ENV without modifying existing values
        Dotenv->load(@sources);

        # sources can also be loaded via import
        use Dotenv -load => 'local.env';

        # add some local stuff to %ENV (from a non-file source)
        # (.env is the default only if there are no arguments)
        Dotenv->load( \%my_env );

        # return a reference to a hash populated with the key/value pairs
        # read in the file, but do not set %ENV
        my $env = Dotenv->parse('app.env');

        # dynamically add to %ENV
        local %ENV = %{ Dotenv->parse( \%ENV, 'test.env' ) };

        # order of arguments matters, so this might yield different results
        # (here, values in 'test.env' take precedence over those in %ENV)
        local %ENV = %{ Dotenv->parse( 'test.env', \%ENV ) };

DESCRIPTION

    "Dotenv" adds support for .env <https://12factor.net/config> to Perl.

    Storing configuration in the environment separate from code comes from
    The Twelve-Factor App methodology. This is done via .env files, which
    contains environment variable definitions akin to those one would write
    for a shell script.

THE "ENV" FORMAT
  Data Format
    The "env" data format is a line-based format consisting of lines of the
    form:

        KEY=VALUE

    The format is somewhat compatible with shell (so with a minimum of
    effort, it's possible to read the environment variables use the "." or
    "source" shell builtins).
